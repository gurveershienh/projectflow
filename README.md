<h1>Project Flow 🎴</h1>
<h3>Another productivity app.</h3>
<p>Building a full stack web application for project tracking. Independently implementing an API with secure session management for the backend (WIP). Looking forward to implementing a clean, responsive UI once the backend is finished.</p>
<p>This app will be for my own use to track my hobby projects, but I'm developing it with external users in mind as an exercise in full stack application development.</p>
<p>No vibe coding 🚫 but Claude is my senior engineer since nobody else wants junior developers 💯</p>
<h4>Tech stack (may or may not change)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Flask</li>
  <li>SQLAlchemy</li>
  <li>React</li>
</ul>
<p>All the tech influencers preach that building in public is key, so I will be committing changes to this repo every few days as the app progresses.</p>
<p>Bye for now! ✌️</p>
